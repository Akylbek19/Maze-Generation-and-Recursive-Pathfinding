# Maze Generator and Solver


A Java application for generating random mazes and finding paths from entry to exit using recursive algorithms.

## Features

- Random maze generation with guaranteed solution
- Visual representation of maze creation process
- Pathfinding using recursive algorithm
- Customizable maze dimensions
- Clear visualization of found path

## Requirements

- Java 8 or higher
- Maven (for building)

## Designations
*   #-walls
*   (space bar) - passageways
* S - the starting point
* E - output
* . - the solution path
